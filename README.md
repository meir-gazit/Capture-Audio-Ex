# Capture-Audio-Ex
The wonderful journey to capture audio from the browser
#
The truth is that I didn't do much, <br />
it happened when I was looking to save someone's conversation from a video I saw on some news site and I found out that I had no way, <br />
I looked in the Google store for some plugin that would allow me to do this, <br />
and when I found one like that I saw that it had a github and from there I could download it and learn what he did and how, <br />
the thought occurred to me that I could ask ChatGpt to shorten the path for me and from there I would continue alone, and here is the result, <br />
it's a bit stressful and spuky to communicate with computers ðŸ¦‡Ëšï½¡ï½¥ï¾Ÿâœ§:ï½¥.:ðŸ¦‡  but here it happens....
